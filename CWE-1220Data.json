{"id": "CWE-1220", "description": "The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.", "hackerone": {"collected_date": "2024-09-04T16:42:33Z", "total_reports": 83, "unique_reports_last_12_weeks": 8, "severity_distribution": {"all_time": {"critical": 0, "high": 0, "medium": 6, "low": 1}}, "change_distribution": {"days_past": 1, "critical": 0, "high": 0, "medium": 1, "low": 0}}, "bugcrowd": {"collected_date": "2024-09-04T16:42:33Z", "vrt_id": [], "parent_vrt_id": [], "vrt_priority": 0}}
