{"id": "CWE-89", "description": "The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.", "hackerone": {"collected_date": "2024-08-22T16:49:03Z", "total_reports": 8096, "unique_reports_last_12_weeks": 244, "severity_distribution": {"all_time": {"critical": 1826, "high": 1494, "medium": 532, "low": 163}}}}
