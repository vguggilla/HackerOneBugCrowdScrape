Title: lack of path sanitization for windows leads to LFI  in parisneo/lollms

Proof of Concept: 
There's many routes that utilize this function that are vulnerable but for the sake of example will test it for personalities route and also  /del_preset route

Browse to the following path

http://127.0.0.1:9600/personalities/%5Cpath%5Cto%5Csensitive%5Cfile.txt

%5C is a backward slash urlencoded



The /del_preset endpoint allows an attacker to delete any file, which will affect the system's availability; for example, the attacker deletes the source code. So availability should be high. refer to this report

Impact: 
Any file on the windows filesystem can be read or deleted by an attacker with access to the Lollms application
