Title: A member can invite/change other users to someone else's project / can change other org's users to own/non-own projects in lunary-ai/lunary

Proof of Concept: 
A)INVITE USERS TO OTHER ORG'S PROJECTS

Log in as a owner in http://localhost:8080. In this test, a free plan user is being used as I do not have a paid plan. This member is ilebarrionuevo+555@gmail.comorgId: f2e845c9-3b01-4d7d-99bb-b9a985bc8f64`
Copy the Authorization token.
Send the following request to send an invitation to any person to the project of another org (ilebarrionuevo@gmail.com owner), by manipulating the project id with the one corresponding to the other user's org. Include the Authorization token from step 2:
ilebarrionuevo@gmail.com project id: 60c090f3-668a-4e9c-b330-24a44dd1f4f7 - orgId: 72cd3972-d8d5-4409-89fd-345fecaa8bae

POST /v1/users HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3333
Content-Length: 107
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiIzMWNkM2U0Yy1hYTMyLTRhMTAtYjA0Mi01MTNlZmUyN2E0NDUiLCJlbWFpbCI6ImlsZWJhcnJpb251ZXZvKzY2NjdAZ21haWwuY29tIiwib3JnSWQiOiJmMmU4NDVjOS0zYjAxLTRkN2QtOTliYi1iOWE5ODViYzhmNjQiLCJleHAiOjE3MTUxMDU2MjIsImlhdCI6MTcxMjUxMzYyMiwibmJmIjoxNzEyNTEzNjIyfQ.4IdnMyhU5SJ2c-MX8sxb5ifMhRoGsrB8mTWFQ--FJnE

{"email":"ilebarrionuevo+686@gmail.com","role":"owner","projects":["60c090f3-668a-4e9c-b330-24a44dd1f4f7"]}

The response shows the user has been invited successfully: Invite user to another org's project
When the invited user accepts the invitation and logs in, the project list is broken and there is no visible project associated (and the org where the user is logged in is not the same as the project that has been joined): User in same org but other org's project
See the orgId and projectId in the following request GET /v1/users/me/org: Inconsistency between OrgId and ProjectId

B)CHANGE OWN MEMBERS TO OTHER ORG'S PROJECTS AND ESCALATING PRIVILEGE

Log in as a owner in http://localhost:8080. In this test, a free plan user is being used as I do not have a paid plan. This member is ilebarrionuevo+555@gmail.comorgId: f2e845c9-3b01-4d7d-99bb-b9a985bc8f64`
Copy the Authorization token.
Send the following request to change a member of THIS org to another project from ANOTHER org not owned by this authenticated user:
Member to be changed: ilebarrionuevo+6667@gmail.com - id: 31cd3e4c-aa32-4a10-b042-513efe27a445
Destination project from other org: projectId: b8a963d7-0eff-4e39-86cd-89fd19b376fd
Also, define the role as Admin / Owner to give this user full permissions in that project:

Note the changes have been applied: User changed to another org's project
If this changed user logs in, will see no project names associated to the account. Note this user is an owner: Empty project names
And the request GET /v1/users/me/org shows the user is associated to the project belonging to another org: Request - other org's project

C)CHANGE OTHER ORG'S MEMBERS TO OWN/OTHER'S PROJECTS

Log in as an owner in http://localhost:8080. In this test, a free plan user is being used as I do not have a paid plan. This member is ilebarrionuevo+555@gmail.comorgId: f2e845c9-3b01-4d7d-99bb-b9a985bc8f64`
Copy the Authorization token.
Send the following request to change a member of ANOTHER org to another project from ANOTHER org (or OWNED org from authenticated user). In this case, we'll change a user to our own org's project:
Member to be changed: ilebarrionuevo+11@gmail.com - id: 48a5300e-8ecc-4556-8d21-8780172727b7
Destination project from owned org: projectId: f32fc9b1-0f05-4f4a-8a98-9b2bbdab0221

{"role":"owner","projects":["f32fc9b1-0f05-4f4a-8a98-9b2bbdab0221"]}

Note the changes have been applied: User from another org changed to own project
If this changed user logs in, will see no project names associated to the account. Note this user is an owner in the other org (we made him to escalate privileges there); he has not been added to our org but to our project: Empty project names
And the request GET /v1/users/me/org shows the user is associated to the project of OUR org, but the org id is still the OTHER one: Request - own org's project

Impact: 
It is possible to associate people to other projects the user does not own in his org, and change users from other orgs to different projects, causing inconsistences in the platform to these users and the org. In these manipulations, it is possible to assign roles with high privileges to those users, allowing them privilege escalation.
