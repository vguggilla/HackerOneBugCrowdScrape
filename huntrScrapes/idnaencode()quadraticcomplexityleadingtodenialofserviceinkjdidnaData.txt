Title: idna encode() quadratic complexity leading to denial of service in kjd/idna

Proof of Concept: 


Impact: 
URL parsing is ubiquitous and relatively small malicious payloads can incur a large computational load. Repeated/concurrent exploitation of this bug in susceptible API endpoints or ingestion mechanisms can reasonably be expected to reduce availability or rack up compute costs.
