Title: Open Redirect due to improper handling in file parameter in imartinez/privategpt

Proof of Concept: 
just visit:
http://localhost:8001/file=https://attacker.com
Done.

Any url passed in file, victim will be redirected there

Impact: 
An "Open Redirect" vulnerability occurs when a web application redirects users to a URL specified by user-controlled input, without properly validating or sanitizing the input. While it might seem innocuous at first glance, an open redirect vulnerability can have significant security implications. Here's how it can be exploited and its potential impact:

Phishing Attacks: Attackers can craft malicious URLs that appear to be legitimate but actually redirect users to phishing websites. For example, an attacker could send a phishing email containing a link to a trusted website with an open redirect vulnerability. When users click on the link, they are redirected to a fake login page where their credentials are stolen. Malware Distribution: Attackers can use open redirects to distribute malware by tricking users into visiting malicious websites. The attacker could disguise the URL as a legitimate website, but the redirection leads to a site that automatically downloads and executes malware onto the user's device. Credential Theft: Open redirects can be used in conjunction with other attack techniques, such as phishing, to steal user credentials. By redirecting users to a fake login page controlled by the attacker, they can harvest usernames and passwords entered by unsuspecting victims.
