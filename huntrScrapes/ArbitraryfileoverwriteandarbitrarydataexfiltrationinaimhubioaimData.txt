Title: Arbitrary file overwrite and arbitrary data exfiltration in aimhubio/aim

Proof of Concept: 


Impact: 
The presented vulnerabilities makes it possible for an attacker to remotely overwrite any file on the host server, and to exfiltrate any data from the host server. This can be abused to cause denial of service by overwriting critical system files, loss of private data, and (eventually) remote code execution by e.g. downloading private ssh-keys.
