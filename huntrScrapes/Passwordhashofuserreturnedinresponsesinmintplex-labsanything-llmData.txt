Title: Password hash of user returned in responses in mintplex-labs/anything-llm

Proof of Concept: 
1- Having a createad account, login at http://127.0.0.1:3001/login?nt=1.

2- Intercept the response to the request POST /api/request-token and see the bcrypt password hash is exposed as part of the User object, which is a bad practice as information is coming to frontend side. See password hash

Impact: 
Although the password hashes are generated using bcrypt, a very strong hashing algorithm, it is highly recommended not to expose any clue about the passwords to frontend site. It would be hard to break the hash for Argon2, but consider not returning this value to frontend. Do not take the risk, just do not expose this value to any user-facing query.

Consider also DTO (Data Transfer Objects) implementation, to return smaller objects to frontend according to the needs of use of the attributes in the corresponding features.
