Proof of Concept: 
POC link which shows bucket is taken over by me :- https://benchmarkai-metrics-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

Impact: 
If the "benchmarkai-metrics-prod" S3 bucket is unclaimed or improperly secured, it could potentially allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or result files uploaded by the script. This may lead to data breaches, exposure of proprietary information, or unauthorized modifications to stored data, posing significant security risks to the organization and its stakeholders.
