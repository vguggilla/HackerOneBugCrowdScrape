Session Hijacking: Malicious scripts can hijack user sessions, allowing attackers to impersonate users, perform unauthorized actions, and access restricted areas of the application.
Reputation Damage: Exploitation of stored XSS vulnerabilities can damage the trust and reputation of the organization, resulting in loss of customer confidence and potential legal consequences.
