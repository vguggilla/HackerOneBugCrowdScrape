Title: Session is not expiring after password resetting in zenml-io/zenml

Proof of Concept: 
Note: Tested on Self-Hosted ZenML deployed via Docker

1. Open http://localhost:8080/login in 2 browsers (I use Firefox and Brave)
2. Log in using these both browser with same login credentials
3. Go to http://localhost:8080/settings/personal-details and click "Update password" from the Firefox browser
4. After password changed, refresh the page on the Brave browser
5. Observe that the session will not expire after password resetting and you can still use an "old" session cookies

Impact: 
There is no way for the victim to revoke access of attacker if account has been already compromised
