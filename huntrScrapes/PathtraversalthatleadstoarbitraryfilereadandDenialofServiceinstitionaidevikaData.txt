Title: Path traversal that leads to arbitrary file read and Denial of Service in stitionai/devika

Proof of Concept: 
1- Arbitrary File Read

send the following request to the server :

http://localhost:1337/api/get-project-files/?project_name=../../../../../../../../../../../../home/anis/example

this will get the content of all files in example directory



2- Denial of Service

it can be achieved by specifying project-name as the root directory

send the following request to the server :

http://localhost:1337/api/get-project-files/?project_name=../../../../../../../../../../../../

this will clog up the backend by trying to read and send the entire content of the filesystem in one request leaving the app unresponsive.
you can check the logs for more details

Impact: 
This vulnerability allows an attacker to retrieve every file present on the system and achieve Denial of Service. It can have great consequences:

Achieving RCE by retrieving private SSH keys
Reading private files
Reading source code for application
Reading configuration files ...
Denial of Service
