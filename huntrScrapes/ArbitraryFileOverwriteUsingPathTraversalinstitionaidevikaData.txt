Title: Arbitrary File Overwrite Using Path Traversal in stitionai/devika

Proof of Concept: 
Create a project named ../test . At this stage, the application receives the folder name from us, not the file name.

Then ask the following question with the name of the file we want to write: The content of the python file named test.py is `print(137)`, what is the output of this file?

When the application finishes the process it will create the file to path "/home/nonroot/devika/data/test/test.py"

Impact: 
The Path Traversal vulnerability enables writing to files in the specified directory
