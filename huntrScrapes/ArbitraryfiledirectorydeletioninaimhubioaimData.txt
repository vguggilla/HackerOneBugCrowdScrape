Title: Arbitrary file/directory deletion in aimhubio/aim

Proof of Concept: 
Host the UI server. I followed the specifications for hosting aim remotely, i.e. a suggested setup for running the software on a remote server. Host the UI (and initialize a repo) by running aim up --repo .. This also specifies the repo-path that the UI should use, in this case in the current working directory. (the repo files are in this case placed within ./.aim)
Create a "target"-file in the current working directory, by running touch deleteme.
From an external client, send the following request:

curl --location "http://HOST_IP:43800/api/runs/delete_batch" --header "Content-Type application:json" --data '[../../../deleteme]'

Impact: 
This vulnerability allows for arbitrary file or directory deletion through path traversal. This can be abused to cause denial of service, or arbitrary data loss.
