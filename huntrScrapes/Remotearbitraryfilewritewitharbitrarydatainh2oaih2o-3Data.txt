Title: Remote arbitrary file write with arbitrary data in h2oai/h2o-3

Proof of Concept: 


Impact: 
The main impact of this vulnerability is being able to write arbitrary data to any arbitrary file on a remote server running h2o-3. In this case, a valid target would for example be to overwrite a private SSH-key allowing for full remote access, or to overwrite script-file that the system is known to run. (The attacker data is always newline-terminated, but most text-based data or SSH-key files are newline-terminated by default, so this should be fine) The full impact will therefore eventually be remote code execution and complete access to the system that h2o-3 is running on.
